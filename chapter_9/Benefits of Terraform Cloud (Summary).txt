How's it going, Cloud Gurus. Welcome to this lesson,
where we'll summarize the features and benefits of the Terraform Cloud offering.
Now let's recap some of the major features of Terraform Cloud.
We have the remote Terraform executions via Terraform Cloud.
Then we get the Cloud workspace,
which offers an organization-based model where each organization or team can
have their own workspace. And this enables cross-workspace sharing of data.
Integration with version control systems, such as GitHub and Bitbucket,
in addition to VCS-triggered runs is a pretty nice feature.
You can manage
state remotely via CLI-based integration with the Terraform Cloud.
This also offers better resilience and security of state file within the
Terraform Cloud itself.
If you're concerned about security or have proprietary modules,
you can host them in private registries offered by Terraform Cloud. And,
of course, Terraform Cloud offers API, UI, and CLI-based access,
which gives you great flexibility when working with it. And finally,
you get cost estimation feature,
which can look at your terraform plan output and estimate
the cost of deployment. This feature is currently available for AWS, GCP,
and Azure.
Integrations with Sentinel for enforcing policies on your code before it is
deployed is also a cool feature.
So this in a nutshell was a summary of Terraform Cloud.
Thank you for going through this lesson.
