Hello, Cloud Gurus!
Welcome to this section on Terraform Cloud and Terraform Cloud
Enterprise Offerings. In this section,
we will cover some best practices,
keeping in view the other features offered by HashiCorp in its Terraform Cloud
and Enterprise offerings. For example,
we'll look at the best practices to secure our Terraform code and deployments
using HashiCorp Sentinel and the Terraform Vault Provider.
We'll also compare and contrast the workspace feature offered by Terraform Open
Source Software (or OSS) and the Terraform Cloud offering.
Finally,
we'll summarize it all at the end with the benefits of using Terraform cloud and
its various features. So, if you've got time, join me in this section!
